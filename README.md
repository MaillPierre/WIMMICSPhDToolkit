# PhD Toolkit
This repository offers a list of tools and advices to the new PhD students and the other researchers.

## Bibliography

### Managing articles

* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a good bibliography manager.
    * There is a Zotero plugin to use automatically SciHub to retrieve PDF when they are not open access: https://github.com/ethanwillis/zotero-scihub.

* W3C recommandations can have a bibtex bibliography entry using the site: https://w2.syronex.com/jmr/w3c-biblio.

### Looking for related works

#### Find PDFs

* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is the google portal specialized for scientific articles. It will show the different versions of an article that are hosted on the web.

* [SciHub](https://sci-hub.se/): Bypassing paywalls is illegal, and you should NOT use a website such as [SciHub](https://sci-hub.se/) to enter a DOI and get the PDF you could not access in return.

* [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/): All french researchers have to upload their research articles in open access to [HAL](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/).

* On Twitter, the hashtag [#canihazpdf](https://twitter.com/hashtag/canihazpdf) given with a reference to an article will signal the community of researchers that you are searching for the PDF of this article.

#### Find articles

* [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) gives you a view of the articles that are connected to a given paper in its field.

* [PURE Suggest](https://fabian-beck.github.io/pure-suggest/) gives you the list of the most related papers in relation to a list of given papers.

* [Litmaps](https://www.litmaps.com/) generates a visualization of the most relevant article related to a given paper.

## Writing

### Grammar, typos and style

* [Hemingway editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/) gives you recommandations on the style of your english.

* [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) is a free grammar check in your browser. It works great with Hemingway.

* [Grammalecte](https://grammalecte.net/) is an open source equivalent to Grammarly, for french.

* [outwrite](https://app.outwrite.com/) another grammarly available in several of languages

### LaTeX

* [The LaTeX article on Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) contains most of the commands that are useful to write a LaTeX document.

* The `savetrees` package automatically reduces the size of the text of your article. There are 3 modes:

    * `\usepackage[subtle]{savetrees}`: Mostly reduce the insertion of whitespaces in text.
    * `\usepackage[moderate]{savetrees}`: Reduces spaces around figures, paragraphs, tables, etc, in a relatively non-style breaking maner.
    * `\usepackage[extreme]{savetrees}`: Not recommended, it reduces everything it can reduce in the article

## Conference/Journal finding

### Conference ranking

* [Conference ranks](http://www.conferenceranks.com/)

* [GII-GRIN-SCIE (GGS) Conference Rating](https://scie.lcc.uma.es:8443/)

## Datasets, Code and Experiments

### Code

* [Anonymous GitHub](https://anonymous.4open.science/) anonymizes your GitHub repo for double blind submissions

### Datasets

* [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

## Networking

* [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/) creates for you an unique identifier and a page in which you can concentrate your publications and links to your different pages on the web.

* [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) is one of the main social networks for researchers. It is particularly useful to find, or even request, PDFs directly on their author page.
